## To do

- Can't "Keep local only"
- Make sure CDK works for "production" (that delete stuff)
- Upload correct data for our donations
- Can't update with sample data
- Verify versions are saved
- Send Amy the information
- Use regular link for "Add donation" and "Add org"
- Security error on sub-route navigation if no key
